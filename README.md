# Pokemon Card Game

Welcome to the Pokemon Card Game!
This project is a fun and interactive card game featuring Pokemon.
The game extracts the names and so far data of Pokemons from the `/api/cards` (PokemonAPI) and challenges players to battle between them. The goal is given a selected card, we aim to determine whether it
can defeat another card in a single attack!
